Comparative analysis:Comparing the performance of the cosine similarity,  k-means and SVM algorithms based on the evaluation metrics(accuracy and precision).Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in terms of recommendation accuracy, diversity, scalability etc.The choice of approach depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the music recommendation system. Cosine similarity offers simplicity, k-means provides personalization through clustering, and SVM delivers predictions based on labeled data.
